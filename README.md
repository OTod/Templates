# IDP_Step3

Template project for web app using React/Angular/Vue? as frontend, node/(probably in the future - c#) as backend, and mongo/postgresql as db. 


Frontend - React/Angular/Vue?
Backend - node/(probably in the future - c#) 
module system?


CI/CD - jenkins/githubActions.

Containerised, so it should be docker/k8s friendly.
